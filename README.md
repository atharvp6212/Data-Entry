# Reception Data-Entry

## GUI build using Tkinter
  I used Pthon's Tkinter module to create GUI. There are many things like Labels, Buttons, Entry box etc... 
  There are two options to enter data, one is Entering data of customer, Entering data of staff members.
  I gave option to see all information of customer and staff members that is stored in database.
  I used VS studio to write code. 
  
### Connected to SQLITE3 Database
  I used Sqlite database to store data that we will enter in GUI.
  Operations on Sqlite are preety simple and easy to use so I choose it.
